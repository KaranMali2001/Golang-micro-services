# Microservices Monorepo (WIP)

This repository contains a monorepo architecture for a microservices-based application written in Go. It is currently **under development** and aims to be a scalable and modular foundation for backend systems.

## ðŸš§ Status: Work In Progress

This project is actively being built. Expect breaking changes, incomplete features, and evolving architecture.

## ðŸš§ Architecture

![alt text](image.png)---

## ðŸ“¦ Structure

```
micro-services/
â”œâ”€â”€ account/           # Account service
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ cmd/           # CLI entrypoints
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ db/            # SQLC config and DB Dockerfile
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ client.go      # Service-to-service or external API client
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ server.go      # Server setup and routing
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ service.go     # Business logic
â”œâ”€â”€ order/             # (Coming soon)
â”œâ”€â”€ product/           # (Coming soon)
â”œâ”€â”€ graphql/           # GraphQL schema and resolvers
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ account_resolver.go
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ app.dockerfile
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ generated.go
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ gqlgen.yml
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ graph.go
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.go
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ models_gen.go
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ models.go
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ mutation_resolver.go
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ query_resolver.go
â”œâ”€â”€ docker-compose.yml # Container orchestration
â”œâ”€â”€ go.mod
â””â”€â”€ go.sum
```

Each service is designed to be self-contained with its own:

- `db/` folder for SQL migrations and sqlc configs
- `graphql/` schema and resolvers using gqlgen
- Business logic in `service.go`

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- **Go** â€“ primary language
- **GraphQL (gqlgen)** â€“ API layer
- **sqlc** â€“ type-safe SQL database access
- **Docker** â€“ containerization of services
- **PostgreSQL** â€“ database (via docker-compose)

## ðŸ“Œ Key Features (Planned)

- Modular service-based architecture
- GraphQL APIs for all services
- Type-safe DB access with raw SQL
- Dockerized development environment
- CI/CD and observability integrations (future)

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KaranMali2001/Golang-micro-services.git
   cd Golang-micro-services
   ```
2. **Start services:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
3. **Run Go services manually (dev):**
   ```bash
   go run account/main.go
   ```

## ðŸ’¡ Vision

This project is an experimental platform for building robust, maintainable backend services in Go. Eventually, this will become a scalable foundation for real-world backend infrastructure.
